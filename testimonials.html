				<p>"Without exception, I must say our recent real estate transaction with Sara was excellent! She positioned our property effectively, then marketed it aggressively, 
				and finally negotiated the transaction with our buyer with great skill. As out-of-state sellers we relied on Sara heavily - and she didn't disappoint us. She stepped in 
				to manage all aspects of the process effectively on our behalf. Her considerable experience, patience, guidance and careful follow-through proved to be definite advantages. 
				We clearly value our partnership with Sara." <br/>

				<p>"Sara's counsel and advice was always supported by careful research. I especially needed that when the first buyer tried to reduce the price during escrow. Her preparation 
				regarding the options open to me in that circumstance made the decision so easy and, as events proved out, very correct. I also very much appreciated her work ethic and timely communication. 
				We never once got behind on anything that needed to be done and this made it possible to close escrow early, even on a short thirty day escrow. Finally, being an attorney, I was extremely 
				comfortable with her handling of all the paperwork.  She understood content as well as the necessity of documenting the terms and events of the transaction. Sara certainly earned her commission in this sale!!!" <br/>

				<p>"Sara Antablian was the office manager for our law firm and worked for us for over thirty years. Sadly for us, she left us to pursue her dream career in real estate. I am a lawyer and practice real estate law primarily. 
				Sara administered our medium-size law office with flawless efficiency and skill. Her intelligence, talent, memory and attention to detail continually kept it running smoothly. We were confidently able to leave the administrative 
				work to her, along with all that came with it. <br/>
				<br/>
				It was about fourteen years ago, Sara commenced her real estate business on evenings and weekends. I learned of the knowledge and skills she had acquired as well as her successes. She continued to work fast and efficiently which 
				have left her clients satisfied with her work. Word of her abilities spread and brought her new clients.<br/>
				<br/>I am impressed by how Sara is always current with the ever-changing real estate markets as well as the many rules, regulations, requirements and practices that govern it. It is not a surprise that she continues this excellence in 
				her real estate business. Sara uses her intelligence and resourcefulness to successfully market a property, to find information from hard-to-access sources and assisted me in estimating property values. I do not hesitate to recommend her to 
				my clients and acquaintances and she is the only real estate agent I would use myself. I speak and meet with Sara regularly and we continue to discuss our work. While my partners and I miss her services, we are very proud of her business accomplishments."

				<p>"I have known and worked with Sara for 30 years and have been referring clients to her for real estate services ever since she began to work in the real estate sales business.<br/><br/>
					I know her to be intelligent, honest, ethical, and competent. <br/><br/>
					
					My clients invariably have been pleased with her services as a sales agent.<br/><br/>
					
					I heartily recommend her."<br/>
